# 1. Overview
The project involves exploratory data analysis on the famous iris dataset, then build supervised and unsupervised machine learning models
to predict the flower type `(setosa,versicolor,verginica)` based on input features `(sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)`.

# 2. Process
The project was fully completed in google colab environment with the valuable contribution of all the team members.

# 3. Conclusion
This project has highly improved our knowledge and expertise in the machine learning field, building machine learning models in both supervised and
unsupervised fields was the perfect way to practice and test our knowledge.
